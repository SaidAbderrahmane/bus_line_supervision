## Project Overview
Performance evaluation of the Saint-SÃ©bastien bus line using real data to predict the number of passengers.

## General Objectives:
- Data analysis and extraction of contextual variables (temporal factors, weather, special events).
- Design of a predictive model for passenger traffic using XGBoost, based on temporal, weather, and event-based data.
- Hyperparameter optimization and evaluation using metrics such as MSE and RMSE to ensure accuracy.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `docs`: contains the project specification and evaluation guidelines.
- `data`: contains the raw datasets used and the extracted features.
- `models`: contains the model used for prediction.
- `main.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook used for data analysis and model prototyping.
- `scrapper.py`: The Python script used to scrape the football games data.
- `requirements.txt`: contains the Python packages required to run the project.


## Setup

- Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
